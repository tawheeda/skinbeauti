      <h3 class="section-title">Welcome to SkinBeaüti</h3>
      <p>
        SkinBeaüti was born from a simple belief: healthy skin should feel effortless. Founded by Mosa in
        Dunkeld, Johannesburg, the studio is a calm retreat where clients learn to care for their skin with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        We start by listening—your lifestyle, goals, and concerns—then tailor treatments using gentle techniques
        and modern skin science. You’ll leave with clear aftercare and a routine that fits real life.
      </p>
      <p>
        From first-time facials to advanced treatments, our mission is to help you look radiant and feel at ease,
        with results that last long after your visit.
